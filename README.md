mpex-sh
=======

Simple shell script for MPEX.co.

Be careful to substitute the "yourKeyID" string with the ID of the actual key you have used to register with mpex.co.
I had to use the option "--trust-model always" because in my linux distribution give errors and in Mac no.

Be free to comment and improve, my knowlwdge of bash is near to zero.

Edit one.
